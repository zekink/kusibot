# Kusibot

Just messing around to teach myself a little more Python.

Based on the tutorial [here](https://realpython.com/how-to-make-a-discord-bot-python/).

## Dependencies

Made with Python 3.8.6 & MacOS, but should run on whatever probably. Requires a few things
which will be later added to a `requirements.txt`. Mainly `discord.py` and `python-dotenv` though.
